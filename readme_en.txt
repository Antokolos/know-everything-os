[center][b]Basic rules[/b][/center]

This game consists of a sequence of questions. The player chooses a topic and a number of questions. You can choose from one to up to three categories at once. You can play with no opponent, against a CPU, or against another player. In no-opponent mode you have unlimited time to answer questions.
Each question may have from one to three correct answers. Questions with multiple correct answers will indicate this by saying "select all that apply".
If there is only one correct answer, when you select your answer, the game will immediately show you whether the given answer was correct and automatically continue to next question after your opponent answers.
If the current question has more than one correct answer, then you will have to confirm your choice by pressing the [i]Confirm[/i] button . 
Each player has 5 lives at the beginning of each game. 
You can finish your game at any moment by clicking the X on the upper part of the screen. However, this will be considered a loss, and your opponent will be victorious. If your opponent answers the question before you do, your opponentâ€™s name in the upper part of the screen will become highlighted.

[center][b]Multiplayer[/b][/center] 

First, you can create a public multiplayer game (look for an opponent) or join an already created multiplayer game in the lobby (join a player who is already looking for someone to play with).
Second, you can create a friends-only multiplayer game only visible to your friends, so that only they can join your game.
Finally, you can create a private, invite-only game and invite one of your friends there. Only the friend you invite to play will be able to see or join your game.
When both players are ready to start a game, each of them should press the [i]Ready[/i] button; after that, the player who created the game can start by pressing [i]Start game[/i].     

[center][b]Score calculation[/b][/center]

Each correct answer can give you from 1 to 5 points depending on how quickly you answer. In no-opponent mode you get only 1 point for each correct answer. 
If you fail to give the correct answer within the given time or give the wrong answer, you will lose one life and you will also get no points for it. At the end of the game, you will get the sum of your points for all correct answers regardless of whether you win or lose. 

[center][b]Victory conditions[/b][/center]

If you lose all your lives, your current game will be lost and your opponent wins. If your opponent loses all of his or her lives, you win.
If both players have at least one life left by the end of the game, the player who got more points will be victorious. 
If both players get the same number of points, the one who has more lives will be victorious. 
If both players get the same number of points and end with the same number of lives, they both will be victorious and will get a certain bonus to their score. 

[center][b]Player rating[/b][/center]

After the game your score will be summed up and your rating on the leaderboard will rise. Keep in mind that even when you lose, you get points for correct answers. When you win a game, you get a bonus equal to some percentage of your score. The percentage equals 30% for a 15-question game, 40% for a 30-question game, and 50% for a 60-question game.  
Against-a-CPU mode and no-opponent mode increase your single-player rating.
Playing against another person increases your multiplayer rating.
